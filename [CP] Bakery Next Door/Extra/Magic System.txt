MAGIC SYSTEM

Rules:
   ➜ Attaining Magic
   Magic can be a natural innate ability possessed by magical races, but it can also be learned through study.

   ➜ Spellcasting
   Spellcasting includes rituals, potions and spoken spells (contrary to the name, they do not have to be spoken aloud). The bigger the scope of the spell, the more taxing it is on the individual, either emotionally, mentally or physically.

   ➜ Innate Focuses
   Innate Focuses are a feature of some magical races, but not all. Innate Focuses indicate paths or sections of magic in which an individual is naturally attuned to or inclined towards.

   ➜ Magic Paths
   Magic is generally split into different paths, covering different aspects of magic and reality which act as limits for what one can achieve using magic. There are 5 basic paths. A magical race can have additional paths, fewer paths or no paths (every individual's magic works the same way with the same limitations).

   The 5 basic paths are: Glamour, Matter, Chance, Connections and Existence.

   Magical races with Innate Focuses can possess an additional path, the Fragmented Paths. Fragmented Paths are innate focuses which failed to form, paths which never were. They're unstable and unpredictable, they might take shape and become a real path, or they might self destruct and cause mass harm, perhaps something in between, no one can know until it happens.

   ➜ Paths

      1. The Path of Glamour
      ➜ The ability to change. Create an illusion, alter appearances, change one's views. This is the Path of Glamour.

      2. The Path of Matter
      ➜ The ability to alter. Transmutation, transformation, shapeshifting, repairing what's broken. This is the Path of Matter.

      3. The Path of Chance
      ➜ The ability to influence. Alter outcomes, influence decisions, predict chance. This is the Path of Chance.   

      4. The Path of Connections
      ➜ The ability to connect. Link together destinies, minds, concepts, observe and sever connections. This is the Path of Connections.

      5. The Path of Existence
      ➜ The ability to adapt. Create new life, destroy it, adapt existing life, heal life. This is the Path of Existence.
